Hi! I am a graduate student at USC Viterbi School of Engineering and will be graduating in Decemeber, 2020. My interests include Natural Language Processing, Information Extraction, Machine Learning and Web Development.
<br /><br />
I have 4 years of industry experience working with Citrix Systems at Bangalore (India) during 2015 to 2018 in the Globalization Services team, starting my journey as an Intern to getting promoted to a Software Engineer 2. 
During my time at Citrix I worked on analyzing large chunks of data from the global customers and converting it into understandable information that helped take crucial business decisions.
I have also worked on various web technologies and have been developing intuitive dashboards and web services for easy consumption and accessibility of information.
My role required a perfect blend of technical skills, leadership, management, communication and team work which helped me grow both personally and professionally.
<br /><br />
I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering in May, 2015 from Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal (India). I served as the Membership Head at the IEEE Student Branch, Manipal 
and was involved with interesting big data projects during my time at Manipal.
<br /><br />
My other interests include photography, playing various musical instruments and sports like swimming and basketball. My love for music and sports made me an active participant in cultural events which played a vital role in honing my social skills.
